📊 Mastering ORDER BY in SQL – Make Your Data Speak Clearly
🚀 Sorting results is as important as fetching them. Here's how to use ORDER BY for clean, meaningful outputs

✅ Sort Ascending (Default)
SELECT name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary;
📈 View from lowest to highest.

✅ Sort Descending
SELECT name FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;
📉 Find top-priced items first.

✅ Sort by Multiple Columns
SELCT * from employees ORDER BY department, salary DESC;
📚 Group by department, then top earners first.

✅ Use with Aliases
SELECT price * 0.9 AS discounted_price FROM items ORDER BY discounted_price;
🎯 Sort on calculated values with ease.

✅ Combine with LIMIT for Top N
SELECT * FROM sales ORDER BY revenue DESC LIMIT 5;
🏆 Show top 5 performers or products.

✅ Sort NULLs Last (Some DBs)
SELECT * from employees ORDER BY last_login NULLS LAST;
🚫 Keep missing data out of the way.

🔍 Advanced SQL ORDER BY – Sorting Beyond the Basics
✅ Use with CASE for Custom Sorting
SELECT * from employees 
ORDER BY 
 CASE status 
 WHEN 'High' THEN 1 
 WHEN 'Medium' THEN 2 
 ELSE 3 
 END;
🎯 Prioritize data based on business rules — not alphabetically.

✅ Sort by Aggregate Values in Subqueries
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS emp_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
ORDER BY emp_count DESC;
📊 Show the largest teams first.

✅ ORDER BY in Window Functions
SELECT name, salary, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank 
FROM employees;
🏆 Rank employees without collapsing rows.

✅ Sort by Date Intervals
SELECT * from employess ORDER BY DATE_PART('month', order_date);
📅 Useful for time-based reporting.

✅ Combine with CTEs
WITH top_sales AS (
 SELECT * FROM sales ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 10
)
SELECT * FROM top_sales ORDER BY region;
🔁 Pre-filter and then sort again for business use cases.

✅ Use in DELETE / UPDATE for Row Priority
DELETE FROM logs WHERE status = 'archived' ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 100;
🧹 Clean old data efficiently.

🔧 Pro Tips
Always specify direction: ASC or DESC for clarity.
Index columns used frequently in ORDER BY for speed.
Avoid ordering on expressions unless necessary — can impact performance.
Combine ORDER BY with indexes, partitions, or window functions to optimize large queries for real-world apps and reports.
