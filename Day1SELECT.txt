🚀 Master the SQL SELECT Statement with Real-World Power Moves
 SQL is more than just syntax — it's how you speak to your data. Here's how I use SELECT every day to drive decisions 👇

1. Basic Data Fetching
SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
📊 Get the essentials — who earns what.

2. Filtering Records
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'Pending';
📦 Find what’s stuck in the pipeline.

3. Aggregation & Grouping
SELECT dept, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY dept;
📈 Team size breakdown in seconds.

4. Sorting Results
SELECT name, sales FROM reps ORDER BY sales DESC;
🏆 Identify top performers instantly.

5. Joins for Combined Insights
SELECT o.id, c.name FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.cust_id = c.id;
🔗 Combine customer and order data 

6. Subqueries to Slice Deeper
SELECT name FROM products WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);
💡 What’s selling above average?

7. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
WITH recent_orders AS (
 SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > CURRENT_DATE - 30
)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recent_orders;
📅 Zoom into last month’s activity
